        Although in none of Plato’s dialogues is Plato himself a conversational partner or even a witness to a conversation, in the Apology Socrates says that Plato is one of several friends in the audience. In this way Plato lets us know that he was an eyewitness of the trial and therefore in the best possible position to write about it. The other account we have of the trial, that of Xenophon, a contemporary of Socrates, is of a very different character. We know that Xenophon was not present as a live witness. He tells his readers that he is reporting only a portion of Socrates’ speech and that he learned about the trial from Hermogenes, a member of the Socratic circle.
