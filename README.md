Hello marketing agency pioneer!
It seems you have stumbled upon my README- and wisely so! 
I have doctored this web page up some to ensure the site meets accessibility standards. 
The title of the page is now wity and descriptive. 
You will find that the link in the top bar of the page leads to other supporting information. 
I took a look at the css page and have removed some redundant formating- and an extra footer.
Also within the css and html, I have made the last default text as "serif" since it was set as "san-serif."
The page is also now responsive to different browser sizes, like mobile devices. 
The text is wrapped so it should be easier to read instead of scrolling to view what is written. 
Lastly, there were just a few spacing/indents that were removed by me just to be a bit cleaner when viewing.
